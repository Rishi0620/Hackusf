# 🏥 KARR Clinic – AI-Powered Skin Cancer Diagnosis

## Overview

KARR Clinic presents a solution that leverages AI to support early skin cancer diagnosis. This project uses a machine learning model that classifies skin cancer lesions as **benign** or **malignant** using NIH-provided image datasets and clinical data.

By integrating AI into the diagnostic workflow, we aim to assist clinicians in making faster and more accurate assessments, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
